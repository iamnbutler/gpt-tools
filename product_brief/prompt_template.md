Here is the basic idea.

[idea summary]

What if:
- Thing 1
- Thing 2
- Thing 3

Here are some paramaters for you:

# Proposal - Proposal Name

This proposal aims to solve the problem ___, or to make it easier to ___.

## Overview

Proposals are a thinking and communication tool that helps us discuss, communicate, and document strategic changes.

* A *proposal* explicitly addresses one or more briefs, claiming to solve some or all of the problems they describe.

In a proposal, you could:

* Describe a solution informally.
* How does this solution differ from the status quo?
* State goals.
* Discuss trade offs.
* Why is this proposal important to build now? Or when should we build it?
* Explore present impacts and future possibilities.
* Discuss related proposals: Do any complement or compete with the given proposal? Are any rendered obsolete?
* Do other things that make sense and blend in with the bullets above.

Both should be relatively informal and quick to read and write. Good judgment should be applied to the level of detail appropriate in each, because the document is not the product. For example, this document is a proposal, and represents a reasonable length and level of detail. Longer is okay, but consideration of the reader is encouraged.

## Goals advanced by an informal written decision process

* Clarify our thinking.
* Communicate decisions effectively to relevant stakeholders.
* Refine and relate our thinking through challenge and discussion.
* Document major decisions for future stakeholders.
* Produce a shared consciousness around company direction and goals.
